==============================
MAP2TOD AND TOD2MAP OPERATIONS
==============================

Most of this file is concerned with defining two functions:

  map2tod(timestream, local_map, xpointing, plan, partial_pixelization=False, debug=False)
  tod2map(local_map, timestream, xpointing, plan, partial_pixelization=False, debug=False)

The map2tod() function overwrites the output TOD array, and the tod2map() function accumulates
its output to the existing map array.

In this top-level docstring, we define central data structures ("global" and "local" maps,
"xpointing", pointing plans, etc.)

Please also refer to this example script: scripts/gpu_mm_example.py

=========================
"GLOBAL" PIXEL-SPACE MAPS
=========================

A "global" map is a 3-d array of shape 

   float32 global_map[3][nypix_global][nxpix_global]   # first coord is {I,Q,U}

where the y-coordinate might be declination, and the x-coordinate might be RA.
Note that maps are indexed as map[y][x], not map[x,y].

The "global" pixelization is specified by three parameters:  

  nypix_global (int)
  nxpix_global (int)
  periodic_xcoord (bool)

The global pixelization might represent the entire sky, even in a situation
where the map-maker is running on a small sky fraction. (The "local map
data structure can be used to avoid storing the full global map -- there's 
no requirement that global maps be stored either on CPU or GPU. See below!)

The 'periodic_xcoord' parameter is intended to offer the choice between
putting "wrapping" logic on the CPU or the GPU. If 'periodic_xcoord' is
true, then the GPU is aware that the global pixelization is periodic, and
will automatically "wrap" the xpointing (see below) in map2tod/tod2map
operations. If 'periodic_xcoord' is false, then the GPU won't perform
"wrapping", and the CPU caller is responsible for wrapping.

===========
TIMESTREAMS
===========

Currently, a timestream is a either a 1-d or a 2-d array

   float32 tod[nsamp];
   float32 tod[ndet][nt];

(Internally, the 2-d case is handled by "flattening" to a 1-d array.)

================
XPOINTING ARRAYS
================

The map2tod/tod2map operations use "exploded pointing" throughout,
represented as either a 2-d or a 3-d array:

   float32 xpointing[3][nsamp];     // axis 0 is {y,x,alpha}
   float32 xpointing[3][ndet][nt];  // axis 0 is {y,x,alpha}

That is, xpointing[0,:] contains (global) y-coordinates and xpointing[1,:]
contains x-coordinates. These coordinates must satisfy the following
constraints:

  1 <= y <= (nypix_global-2)
  1 <= x <= (nxpix_global-2)                  if periodic_xcoord == False
  -nxpix_global+1 <= x <= 2*nxpix_global-2    if periodic_xcoord == True

That is, the global pixelization must be "at least large enough to contain the
xpointing", even if the map-maker is running on a smaller sky fraction (see
next item, "Local maps").

The 'alpha' values in xpointing[2,:] are detector angles, defined by the
statement that detectors measure:

   T + cos(2*alpha)*Q + sin(2*alpha)*U

========================
"LOCAL" PIXEL-SPACE MAPS
========================

This is the most complicated part, since it's designed to represent a
variety of data layouts.

Consider a situation where we don't want to store an entire global map in
memory. (This could either be on the GPU or CPU.) We define a "local map"
data structure, to store a partial sky map, as follows.

We divide the global map into 64-by-64 "cells". A local map is an arbitrary
set of cells, packed into a contiguous memory region of length (3*64*64*ncells).

(If nxpix_global or nypix_global is not divisible by 64, then the local map may
include some "boundary" pixels which are not in the global map. This is allowed,
and boundary pixels are ignored by the tod2map() and map2tod() operations.)

We define the following data structure (the "local pixelization") which describes 
which cells are stored, and how cells are mapped to memory addresses:

  cell_offsets   2-d integer-valued array indexed by (iycell, ixcell)
  ystride        integer
  polstride      integer

These members have the following meaning. Consider one cell in the _global_ 
map, i.e. pixel index ranges

   64*iycell <= iypix_global < 64*(iycell+1)
   64*iycell <= iypix_global < 64*(iycell+1)

If cell_offsets[iycell,ixcell] is negative, then cell (iycell, ixcell)
is not stored as part of the local map.

If cell_offsets[iycell,ixcell] is >= 0, then the cell is a logical array
of shape (3,64,64), and array element (pol,iy,ix) is stored at the
following memory address:

  cell_offsets[iycell,ixcell] + (pol * polstride) + (iy * ystride) + ix

Here are some examples of local maps, just to illustrate the flexibility:

 - Consider a rectangular subset of the global map, represented as a 3-d
   contiguous array with shape:

     float32 local_map[3][64*nycells][64*nxcells]

   This could be represented as a local map with:

     ystride = 64*nxcells
     polstride = 64*64*nycells*nxcells
      (cell_offsets chosen appropriately)

 - Consider a 1-d array of cells, where each cell is contiguous in memory,
   represented as a 4-d array:

     float32 local_map[ncells][3][64][64]

   This could be represented as a local map with:

     ystride = 64
     polstride = 64*64
      (cell_offsets chosen appropriately)

   (This type of memory layout is used in "dynamic" maps, see next section.)

==========================
"DYNAMIC" PIXEL-SPACE MAPS
==========================

A DynamicMap is a LocalMap which starts empty (i.e. with zero cells), and adds
cells as needed, whenever tod2map() is called. After all TODs have been processed,
you call DynamicMap.finalize() to convert the DynamicMap to a LocalMap.

DynamicMaps always use a memory layout of the form

   float32 local_map[ncells][3][64][64];

where 'ncells' increases dynamically when tod2map() is called. The cell ordering
is arbitrary, and can be inspected after calling DynamicMap.finalize(). For details
on how this works (and for more info on DynamicMaps in general), see the DynamicMap
docstring.

(Context: recall that a maximum likelihood map-maker runs in two stages: a 
"dirty map" stage, followed by a CG stage. The first stage could use a DynamicMap 
to determine which map cells are needed on each MPI task. At the end of the first
stage, DynamicMap.finalize() can called, to "freeze in" the pixelization. The CG
stage would use only LocalMaps -- no DynamicMaps.)

=================
MPI PIXELIZATIONS
=================

The MpiPixelization class distributes map cells across MPI tasks. It defines three 
pixelizations on each MPI task. (These are instances of class LocalPixelization.)

  - self.toplevel_pixelization: assigns each map cell in the survey footprint to a
     unique MPI task. The toplevel pixelization is used to represent maps in the
     high-level CG solver.

  - self.working_pixelization: defines a many-to-one mapping between map cells and
     MPI tasks, such that each MPI task is assigned all cells which are "hit" by any
     of the task's TODs. The working pixelization is used in tod2map() and map2tod().

  - self.root_pixelization: assigns all map cells to the root task.

The MpiPixelization class also defines methods for converting maps between pixelizations
(broadcast(), reduce(), gather()), which are written with the CG solver in mind. For
more info, see the MpiPixelization docstring.


===============================
POINTING "PLANS" AND "PREPLANS"
===============================

The most complicated part of the code is creating a "PointingPlan" on the GPU.
This is a parallel data structure that is initialized from an xpointing array,
and accelerates map2tod/tod2map operations.

I won't describe the plan in detail, except to say that we factor plan creation
into two steps:

   - Create PointingPrePlan from xpointing array (takes ~5 milliseconds
     and needs a few KB to store)

   - Create PointingPlan from PointingPrePlan + xpointing array (takes ~5
     milliseconds and needs ~100 MB to store)

The idea is that PointingPrePlans are small and can be retained (per-TOD)
for the duration of the map-maker, whereas PointingPlans are large and 
should be created/destroyed on the fly.

=========
TODO LIST
=========

  - Right now the code is not very well tested! I think testing is my 
    next priority.

  - Currently, the number of TOD samples 'nsamp' must be a multiple of 32.
    (I'd like to change this, but it's not totally trivial, and there are a
     few minor issues I'd like to chat about.)

  - Helper functions for converting maps between different pixelizations
    (either local or global, with or without wrapping logic).

  - Kernels should be launched on current cupy stream (I'm currently launching
    on the default cuda stream).

  - Support both float32 and float64.

  - There are still some optimizations I'd like to explore, for making map2tod()
    and tod2map() even faster, but I put this on the back-burner since they're
    pretty fast already.

  - Not currently pip-installable (or conda-installable). This turned out to 
    be a real headache. I put it "on pause" but I plan to go back to it later.

None of these todo items should be a lot of work individually, but I'm not sure 
how to prioritize.

        """
        A DynamicMap is a LocalMap which starts empty (i.e. with zero cells), and adds
        cells as needed, whenever tod2map() is called. After all TODs have been processed,
        you call DynamicMap.finalize() to convert the DynamicMap to a LocalMap.

        DynamicMaps always use a memory layout of the form

            float32 local_map[ncells][3][64][64];

        where 'ncells' increases dynamically when tod2map() is called. The cell ordering is
        arbitrary, and can be inspected after calling DynamicMap.finalize() -- see below.

        The meaning of the 'cell_mask' argument needs some explanation. This is intended for
        a situation where you're running the map maker on a "target" subset of the sky, and 
        want to ignore pixels outside the subset. In this case, 'cell_mask' should be a boolean 
        array of shape (nycells, nxcells), which is True in the "target" region. Then the
        DynamicMap() will only add cells which are in the target region.

        Here is some example code which explains typical usage of DynamicMap:

            dmap = DynamicMap(nypix_global, nxpix_global, dtype)

            for (tod, xpointing) in ...:
                # Here, 'tod' is a cupy array with shape (ndet,nt) or (nt,)
                # and 'xpointing' is a cupy array with shape (3,ndet,nt) or (3,nt).

                preplan = PointingPrePlan(xpointing, nypix_global, nxpix_global)
                plan = PointingPlan(preplan, xpointing)
                tod2map(dmap, tod, xpointing, plan)  # dynamically expands 'dmap'

            # Finalize (converts DynamicMap -> LocalMap).
            local_map = dmap.finalize()          # instance of class LocalMap 
            local_pix = local_map.pixelization   # instance of class LocalPixelization
            local_arr = local_map.arr            # cupy array, shape (ncells,3,64,64).

            # The memory layout is: float32 local_map[ncells][3][64][64].
            # This is encoded (including cell ordering) by the 2-d 'cell_offsets_cpu' array 
            # in the LocalPixelization. If the i-th cell has indices (iycell, ixcell),
            # then cell_offsets_cpu[iycell,ixcell] will be (3*64*64*i). Cells which are
            # not "touched" are represented by negative entries in the cell_offsets array.

        Some limitations of the current code (easy to change -- LMK if you need this):

           - DynamicMap supports tod2map() but not map2tod().
           - Can only inspect the cell ordering by calling finalize() at the end.
           - Cell ordering is nondetermininstic (!)

class MpiPixelization:
    def __init__(self, dmap, noisy=True, npy_filename=None, comm=None):
        """Distributes map cells across MPI tasks.

        The main purpose of this class is to define three pixelizations on each MPI task.
        (These are instances of class LocalPixelization.)

          - self.toplevel_pixelization: assigns each map cell in the survey footprint to a
             unique MPI task. The toplevel pixelization is used to represent maps in the
             high-level CG solver.

          - self.working_pixelization: defines a many-to-one mapping between map cells and
             MPI tasks, such that each MPI task is assigned all cells which are "hit" by any
             of the task's TODs. The working pixelization is used in tod2map() and map2tod().

          - self.root_pixelization: puts all map cells on the root task. Currently only used
             in gather().

        And the following three methods, which are used to convert between pixelizations 
        in the CG solver:

          - broadcast(toplevel_map) -> (working_map).
            Sends each map cell to all MPI tasks which "hit" the cell.
            Called at the beginning of each CG iteration, before any map2tod() calls.

          - reduce(working_map) -> (toplevel_map).
            For each map cell, sum the cell contents over all MPI tasks which "hit" the cell.
            Called at the end of each CG iteration, to accumulate all tod2map() outputs.

          - gather(toplevel_map) -> (root_map).
            Called at the end of the CG solver, to gather the map into a single array,
            in order to write to disk. (You may also want to call LocalMap.to_global(),
            see the gather() docstring)

        Constructor arguments:

         - dmap: a DynamicMap on each MPI task. This tells the MpiPixelization constructor
            which map cells are "hit" by which MPI task(s).

         - noisy: if True, then some diagnostic info is printed (on MPI task 0).

         - npy_filename: if specified, then a .npy file will be saved (on MPI task 0)
            which can be used to reconstruct the MpiPixelization. This is intended in
            order to save examples, for experimenting with load-balancing algorithms.

         - comm: an MPI communicator (if unspecified, then MPI.COMM_WORLD is used)

        Note 1: The MpiPixelization constructor permutes the cell ordering in 'dmap',
        in order to make the orering more MPI-friendly! I think this should always be
        okay, since the cell ordering is arbitrary anyway.

        Note 2: The MpiPixelization constructor finalizes the 'dmap' pixelization, but does
        not finalize the map itself. (This means that you can still call dmap.finalize(),
        but you can't further enlarge the pixelization with tod2map(dmap, ...).

        Note 3: I'm currently using a simple load-balancing algorithm that gives decent results
        in cases where I've tried it, but I might experiment with fancier algorithms later. 
        For more info, see the CellAssignment docstring.

        The constructor initializes the following members:

           self.cell_owners      shape (nycells,nxcells) array containing MPI rank of each cell's owner (or -1)
           self.toplevel_ncells  length (ntasks) array, contains number of cells owned by each task

        I'm currently using the following simple cell assignment algorithm:

          - Define the "weight" of a cell to be the number of tasks which hit the cell.

          - Sort cells by weight.

          - For each cell, consider only tasks which hit the cell, and choose the task which
            currently has the smallest value of the cost function:

               Cost(task) = sum_{cells assigned to task} (5 + weight(cell))
